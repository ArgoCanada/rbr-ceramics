# 4902617

This float is not in the Argo Index as it never reported a profile. Directory contains the floats original test data from NKE and at BIO (June 2022, Sept 2023), initial deployment messages where it immediately went into EOL, and the most recent ones (yesterday - the float is still alive!). Tried hard resetting a couple times as well as changing technical parameters. 

This float had its firmware upgraded to support 1Hz sampling from the RBR CTD. Floats 4902618 abd 4902619 were similarly upgraded but did not show any failure.
